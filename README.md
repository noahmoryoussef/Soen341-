## Project Description

We are a group of four engineering students composed of three computer engineers and one software engineering. We will be implementing a simplified version of the Instagram application. This will include features: posting a picture (text description available), following a user and leaving comments to a posted posted picture. Additional extra features will be included such as like, sharing posts, direct messaging between users, and giving user accounts an option to be private or public.
